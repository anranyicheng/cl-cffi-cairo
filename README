cl-cffi-cairo is a Lisp binding to the Cairo library.

Cairo is a 2D graphics library with support for multiple output devices.
Currently supported output targets include the X Window System (via both Xlib
and XCB), Quartz, Win32, image buffers, PostScript, PDF, and SVG file output.

Cairo is designed to produce consistent output on all output media while taking
advantage of display hardware acceleration when available (eg. through the X
Render Extension).

The cairo API provides operations similar to the drawing operators of PostScript
and PDF. Operations in cairo including stroking and filling cubic BÃ©zier
splines, transforming and compositing translucent images, and antialiased text
rendering. All drawing operations can be transformed by any affine
transformation (scale, rotation, shear, etc.)

This library is loaded from the cl-cffi-gtk3 library for a Lisp binding to
GTK 3 and the cl-cffi-gtk4 library for a Lisp binding to GTK 4.

The cl-cffi-gdk-pixbuf library was part of the cl-cffi-gtk library and was
separated out to be used independently. The former cl-cffi-gtk library is
replaced with the cl-cffi-gtk3 for GTK 3 and the cl-cffi-gtk4 library for GTK 4.
